 <h3>Once you’re ready to go click on ‘Get Started’. Now here there are different ways that you can install Font Awesome. You can actually download it and customize the LESS but what we’re going to do is just copy and paste this line of code into our header. That’s the easiest and fastest way to get started with Font Awesome.

Once you’ve copied it, go back to your HTML editor and add that line of code to your header. Now one thing to mention is that if you’re developing locally and you’re not on a hosted server, you’re going to have to add HTTP: for this to work.</h3>
